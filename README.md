# Lyra

Lyra is a post-processing Python package developed for the University of Massachusetts Hirshfield Dowd Observatory. It is designed for the analysis and visualization of raw astronomical light curve data. The package is named after the first collection of scientific data gathered on a full period of a variable star in the constellation Lyra during the summer of 2024.

## Description
Lyra provides tools to process and analyze photometric data from astronomical observations. It is intended to be used directly after the photometric analysis performed by the AstroimageJ program, offering advanced capabilities for data analysis and visualization.
